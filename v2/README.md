## We invest in hard tech and hard sectors

#### Nuclear reactor. Organoids sawmills. Drone swarms. Surgical robots. Farm automation. 3d printers. Industrial scale batteries. IVF 2.0.

#### _The 21st century is going to be amazing_.

We're hyper curious and love ambitious founders and ideas. If you're building something valuable and hard, and that very few people in the world can build, then we want to work with you.

* Storytelling for a wider audience
* Customer intros and expert intros
* Temporary SF office space, service provider and software discounts, and more
