[About](https://humbaventures.com/#about) &#124; [Team](https://humbaventures.com/#team) &#124; [Portfolio](https://humbaventures.com/#portfolio) &#124; [Working with Humba](https://humbaventures.com/support) &#124; [Blog](https://blog.humbaventures.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} &#124; [Jobs at Humba Companies](https://jobs.humbaventures.com/jobs){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

### ABOUT

Humba Ventures is a pre-seed and seed fund in the [Susa Ventures](https://www.susaventures.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} family. While Susa Ventures is focused on leading early stage rounds in traditional sectors like enterprise SaaS, fintech, healthcare, and logistics, Humba Ventures is mainly focused on smaller, emerging sectors and technologies like robotics and manufacturing, climate and energy, and defense and security. In its early days, Humba occasionally invested as a supportive, non-lead investor in traditional sectors.

Humba typically writes $250k-$1m core checks with a high engagement model.

We bring over a decade of institutional VC experience developed through supporting companies like Robinhood, Flexport, and Mux at their earliest stages, and apply that experience to founders building companies at the frontiers of technology.
