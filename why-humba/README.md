# Why Humba?

_TLDR: engaged, low-friction support; highly effective follow-on funding help; the perspective of a technical investor with 10+ years of VC experience and a writer who's excellent at explaining technical topics to broader audiences; significant discounts across numerous software and service providers; and access to our SF office space if you're visiting from out of town._

* We have 3-4x the follow-on rate compared to the industry average. Over 60% of seed companies we work with raise a Series A, vs. [15-20%](https://x.com/PeterJ_Walker/status/1923424942747680953){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for early-stage startups in general.
* Being part of the broader Susa Ventures fund family (~$800m AUM) allows us to offer outsized resources: online talks from expert speakers, negotiated software and service provider discounts, office space that you can use in SF if you're coming in from out of town, etc. Humba's check size is that of a $40m fund, but our resources are similar to those of a $100m+ fund.
* The Humba+Susa team has a very large combined network, which can be helpful for finding experts, investors, customers, etc.
* Leo is a technical VC (Caltech BS, 10 years as a software engineer, still thinks and reasons like a software engineer despite being rusty ðŸ˜…), so he can discuss opportunities and challenges that are hard to cover with non-technical investors.
* Leo was one of the first engineers at several startups ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Factual](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factual){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), and the combination of that experience and a VC's perspective makes him especially effective at helping to close key job candidates.
* One of Anna's superpowers is distilling technical concepts for mass audiences, which is something we love to assist with as companies start telling their stories publicly. Examples of Anna's writing: [Foundations and Frontiers](https://www.contrary.com/foundations-and-frontiers){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Notch Magazine](https://notch.ink/themanylivesofenergy/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and Humba's own [blog](https://blog.humbaventures.com/s/how-its-built){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
* Abhijeet has an interdisciplinary background (EE->Bio) and previously founded a biotech startup. He has built communities of deep tech founders and operators, and he spent time at Gingko Bioworksâ€™ accelerator where he helped commercialize research projects. He has seen bio and biomanufacturing from almost every perspective, and has encyclopedic knowledge and broad investor and operator networks in these areas.
* Humba guarantees 15% of its initial investment into your next priced round, as long as that round gives you at least 18 months of runway. E.g., if we invested $500k into your seed round, we promise to invest $75k in your Series A. This approach has a few important implications:
    * We are aligned from day one. We are not writing "option checks" to see how things play out before putting in a lot more capital; we are investing because we believe in you and your vision today.
    * Most investors will aggressively seek to maintain their initial ownership stakes, while we are going to be diluted along with you over the life of your company. This creates less dilution to you from Humba over time.
    * Our participation sends a positive signal to next round's investors -- or at least doesn't send a negative one -- because we are going to participate in the next round regardless of the terms or the lead investor, as long as the round gives you a reasonable amount of runway.
* We are engaged but not meddlesome. We're non-judgmental and supportive whether things are going well or you're struggling, and founders love working with us (our [NPS](https://www.surveysensum.com/blog/what-is-a-good-net-promoter-score){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the end of 2024 was 86).
