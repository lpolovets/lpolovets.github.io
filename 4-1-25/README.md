We're excited to announce our pivot from deep tech to shallow tech! We've been [beating](https://www.codingvc.com/p/betting-on-deep-tech) the [drum](https://www.codingvc.com/p/the-golden-age-of-deep-tech) for deep tech for the last few years, and tbh we're tired. It takes a lot of work to build [nuclear microreactors](https://antaresindustries.com/) or [organoids that accelerate drug testing](https://www.parallel.bio/) or [multistory warehouse robotics solutions](https://mytra.ai/) when you can build and launch a product with a prompt that's shorter than this paragraph.

It's clear to us that the market has spoken:

So, we're excited to announce Humba's new AI^2 initiative!

We are **A**ll-**I**n on **AI**!

To make this more concrete, here's our new investing critera:
* Is your company less than 3 weeks old but wildly profitable? (If you're not wildly profitable, maybe venture capital funding is not for you.)
* Can you vibe code, ~~test,~~ and launch at least 3 major features during our pitch meeting?
* Is at least 100% of your code written by Cursor or Claude? We are extremely bullish on companies without any engineers on the team.
* Have at least 10 competitors launch this week to "validate the space"? If not, maybe what you're building is just too hard and you should consider pivoting to a different ChatGPT prompt.

Other VCs invest in price rounds or on notes with a discount to the next round, but we think those models are antiquated. That's why we only invest on notes with a premium to the next round. AGI is going to lead to explosive growth, and our entry prices should relfect that.

If your fit our new criteria and find our investment offer attractive, please have your AI agent reach out to our AI agent. They'll know what that means.
